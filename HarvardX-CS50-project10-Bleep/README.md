# Project 10 - Bleep
Implement a program that censors messages that contain words that appear on a list of supplied "banned words."

```
$ python bleep.py banned.txt
What message would you like to censor?
What the heck
What the ****
$ python bleep.py banned.txt
What message would you like to censor?
gosh darn it
**** **** it
```

## Specification
Complete the implementation of  `bleep.py`  in such a way that it:

-   Accepts as its sole command-line argument the name (or path) of a dictionary of banned words (i.e., text file).
    
-   Opens and reads from that file the list of words stored therein, one per line, and stores each in a Python data structure for later access. While a Python  `list`  will work well for this, you may also find a  [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)  useful here.
    
-   If no command line argument (e.g.,  `banned.txt`) is provided, be sure to have your program  [exit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit)  with a status code of  `1`.
    
-   You may assume that any text files the staff tests with will have one word per line (each line terminated with a  `\n`), and any alphabetic characters in those words will be lowercase.
    
-   Prompts the user to provide a message.
    
-   Tokenizes that message into its individual component words, using the  [`split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split)  method on the provided string, and then iterates over the  `list`  of "tokens" (words) that is returned by calling  `split`, checking to see whether any of the tokens match, case-insensitively, any of the words in the banned words list.
    
-   Prints back the message that the user provided, except if the message contained any banned words, each of its characters is replaced by a  `*`.
    
-   For example,  `gosh`  should be replaced with four  `*`  characters, while  `fudge`  should be replaced with five.
    
-   You should not censor words that merely contain a banned word as a substring. For example, if  **bar**  is a banned word in the provided list, then none of  _**bar**ns_  nor  _crow**bar**_  nor  _wheel**bar**row_  should be censored.
    
-   You explicitly  **do not**  need to support input strings that contain punctuation marks. You may assume we will only test your input where each word is only separated by whitespace.

## Usage
Your program should behave per the examples below.

```
$ python bleep.py
Usage: python bleep.py dictionary
```

```
$ python bleep.py list1.txt list2.txt list3.txt
Usage: python bleep.py dictionary
```

```
$ python bleep.py banned.txt
What message would you like to censor?
hello world
hello world
```

```
$ python bleep.py banned.txt
What message would you like to censor?
what the heck
what the ****
```

```
$ python bleep.py banned.txt
What message would you like to censor?
gosh darn it
**** **** it
```
